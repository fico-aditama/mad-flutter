# Mad Puzzle Application

## Overview

This repository contains the code for the Mad Puzzle application, including the updated Flutter code and unit tests for the project.

## Function Selection

### Chosen Function

The chosen function for unit testing is `exploreCrosswordSolutions`. This function is part of the core logic for generating crossword solutions. It explores potential solutions for a crossword puzzle using a stream and leverages asynchronous operations to handle large sets of data efficiently.

### AAA Pattern

In the test for `exploreCrosswordSolutions`, the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern was used:

1. **Arrange**: The initial setup involves creating mock data and configurations necessary for the test, including setting up a mock `Crossword` and `BuiltSet<String>`.

2. **Act**: The test invokes the `exploreCrosswordSolutions` function, providing it with the arranged data to simulate the crossword solving process.

3. **Assert**: The test verifies that the output of the function matches expected results, including checking the completion status of the crossword and ensuring no errors occurred.

## Test Setup

The test sets up initial conditions by creating mock instances of the `Crossword`, `BuiltSet<String>`, and other related classes. The input data is configured to simulate realistic scenarios the function might encounter during execution.

## Test Code

The test code effectively follows the AAA pattern to ensure clarity and correctness. The assertions validate the function's behavior and outputs to ensure they align with the expected results.

## Code Clarity

The test code is well-formatted and easy to understand, adhering to best practices for unit testing in Flutter. Each section of the test follows a clear structure, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.
